									<p>The dataset is from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations – businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.</p>
<p><b>Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding</b>
<br/><b>1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:</b>
<br/>i. Attribute table = 10,000
<br/>ii. Business table = 10,000
<br/>iii. Category table = 10,000
<br/>iv. Checkin table = 10,000
<br/>v. elite_years table = 10,000
<br/>vi. friend table = 10,000
<br/>vii. hours table = 10,000
<br/>viii. photo table = 10,000
<br/>ix. review table = 10,000
<br/>x. tip table = 10,000
<br/>xi. user table = 10,000
<br/>
<br/><b>2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.</b>
<br/>i. Business = 10,000 (primary)
<br/>ii. Hours = 1,562 (business_id) 
<br/>iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
<br/>iv. Attribute = 1,115 (business_id)
<br/>v. Review = 10,000 (primary)
<br/>vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
<br/>vii. Photo = 10,000 (primary)
<br/>viii. Tip = 3,979 (business_id)
<br/>ix. User = 10,000 (primary)
<br/>x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
<br/>xi. Elite_years = 2,780 (user_id)
<br/>Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

<br/>Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
<br/>Use the SQL code below, we can calculate the r_squared of 0.43, which is half way between 0 and 1 . This means 43% of movements in fans can be explained by movements in review_count. Hence, we can conclude that having more review slightly correlate with more fans.

<br/><b>Part 2: Inferences and Analysis</b>
<br/><b>1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.</b>
<br/>city = Toronto; category = Restaurants
<br/><b>i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?</b>
<br/>Businesses in the 2-3 star group same similar opening hours, suggesting that they cater to similar customers. The 4-5 star group, on the other hand, has widely different opening hours between them, suggesting they each target a different type of customers. 	
<br/>2-3 star group: typically open from 9-11:00 and close at 21-23:00 everyday of the week (conventional opening hours for restaurants)
<br/>select

<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	and category.category = 'Restaurants';	
<br/>4-5 star group: open hours vary accross businesses: Sushi Osaka one opens traditional hours (11-23:00); Edulis opens for dinners on Wednesday-Saturday and for lunchs on Sunday; Cabin Fever opens from afternoon to 2am the next day.
<br/>select
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		business.name,
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		business.city,

<br/>and category.category = 'Restaurants';
<br/>
<br/><b>ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?</b>
<br/>Overall, the number of reviews vary between the two groups, but also among businesses in the same group. Both groups have business(s) with less than 10 reviews but also have some with a lot of reviews. However, the 4-5 star group have more reviews on average.

<br/>
<br/><b>iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.</b>
<br/>Businesses with similar star ratings tend to stay close to each other (clustering). Clustering can be explained by game theory and specifically by “Hotelling’s Model of Spatial Competition.” In this case, 4-5 star restaurants stay further to the West (longitude < -79.4) and 2-3 star restaurants can be found on the East (longitude > -79.4).

<br/><b>3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.</b>
<br/><b>i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: How long does it take, on average, for a user to join the Elite squad since they start yelping.</b>
<br/>			 
<br/><b>ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:</b>
<br/>To arrive at the final dataset, we need to find the year that a person starts yelping and the first year that person is an elite. To extract the year from the yelping_since column in user, we use strftime function. Then, we use the min function to grab the first a person become elite. Finally, we subtract the first yelping year from the first elite year and calculate the average of all the results. Overall, it takes almost 2 years (1.9) to reach elite status.                       
<br/>				  
<br/><b>iii. Output of your finished dataset:</b>
<br/>	+---------------+
<br/>	|      avg_time |
<br/>	+---------------+
<br/>	| 1.90476190476 |
<br/>	+---------------+    
<br/>
<br/><b>iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:</b>
<br/>select  
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	avg(first_e_year-first_y_year) as avg_time
<br/>from (
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	select
