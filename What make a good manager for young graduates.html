								<p>
									A good manager is vital for young graduates navigating their first job experiences and transitioning from academic to professional life. Good managers invest in their group, earning respect and loyalty of their team members. In my professional journey, I have worked with several managers, observing their behaviours and teams. I noticed a few key characteristics of good managers that would greatly benefit new graduates. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Passion</b>: Those who go to work with a smile and are passionate about their work can significantly impact new graduates. Passionate managers set a positive tone for the workplace and can inspire recent graduates to be enthusiastic about their work. Passionate managers may also be more invested in their teams and the organisation's success, leading to better outcomes.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Passionate managers can also serve as role models for new graduates, demonstrating what it means to be engaged and committed to one's work. They can share their stories of discovering their passion and why they love what they do, which can inspire new graduates who may still be figuring out their career paths.
								</p>
								<p>	
									In addition to setting a positive tone, passionate managers are more likely to encourage their team to pursue their passions and interests. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated workforce, as team members feel that their work is aligned with their personal goals and values.
								</p>
								<p>	
									<b>Communications</b>: Effective communication is crucial for new graduates who may still learn the ropes of their job and the workplace. Managers who are skilled communicators can help recent graduates feel more comfortable and confident in their roles, as well as help them understand their responsibilities and goals.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Sharing information with staff is an essential aspect of effective communication. Managers should keep their team informed about what is happening in the organisation, any changes or updates, and how their work fits into the bigger picture. They should also be transparent about their decision-making process and explain why certain decisions are being made. This can help new graduates feel more involved and invested in their work.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Another important aspect of communication is listening. Managers should actively listen to their staff and be open to feedback and suggestions. They should create a safe and supportive environment where staff feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns. This can help new graduates feel more valued and respected and can also lead to better decision-making and problem-solving.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Regular check-ins or catch-up meetings are also crucial for effective communication. Managers should schedule regular one-on-one meetings with their staff to discuss work progress, address concerns, and provide feedback. These meetings can help new graduates feel more supported and connected to their manager and the organisation.
								</p>
								<p>	
									I appreciate one of my previous managers who set up a weekly meeting with the team right after his weekly meeting with senior managers. He shared his notes and opinions and encouraged everyone to express their views, too. Via those meetings, I truly felt valued and a part of the broader organisation. 
								</p>
								<p>	
									Finally, managers who are effective communicators should also be able to adapt their communication style to the needs of their team members. This may include using different modes of communication (e.g. email, phone, in-person meetings) or adjusting their communication style based on each team member's needs and preferences.

								<p>	
									<b>A positive attitude about learning</b>: The world constantly evolves, and the workplace is no exception. New graduates must be adaptable and willing to learn new skills and technologies. Managers who demonstrate a positive attitude towards learning and growth can help foster a culture of continuous learning and development within the organisation.
								</p>
								<p>	
									A manager with a positive learning attitude can inspire team members to seek new challenges and growth opportunities. They may encourage staff to attend training sessions, take courses, or pursue certifications to develop new skills or enhance existing ones. This can help recent graduates feel more confident in their abilities and better prepared to take on new challenges.
								</p>
								<p>	
									When I started my first full-time role, I thought my Excel skill was decent. In the first week into the role, my manager showed me what he could do with Power Query and Power Pivot. He blew my mind away. I took several courses in Power Query, Power Pivot and Dax. I now build all my reports with Power Query and have not ever looked back.  
								</p>
								<p>	
									Additionally, a manager who is open to learning themselves can set an example for their team members. They may seek new information, attend conferences or workshops, or participate in professional development opportunities. This can show recent graduates that learning is essential, enjoyable, and rewarding.
								</p>
								<p>	
									A manager with a positive learning attitude may be more open to new ideas and perspectives. They may be more willing to consider new approaches or technologies to help the organisation stay competitive and adapt to changing circumstances. This is particularly important for recent graduates who bring fresh perspectives and ideas.
								</p>
								<p>	
									<b>Flexibility</b>: Achieving a work-life balance is challenging for many people, especially new graduates who may be adjusting to the demands of their first job. Managers who prioritise flexibility in the workplace can help recent graduates feel supported and empowered to manage their work and personal lives.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Flexibility can take many forms, including flexible scheduling, remote work options, and paid time off. Managers who are open to these options can help new graduates better manage their schedules and reduce stress levels, which can lead to better job performance and overall job satisfaction.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Moreover, flexible managers may be more understanding of unexpected events or emergencies that may arise. They may be willing to work with new graduates to find solutions that accommodate their needs and help them achieve a healthy work-life balance.
								</p>
								<p>	
									It's also worth noting that flexibility can extend beyond scheduling and time off policies. A flexible manager may be open to new ideas or approaches and may be willing to adjust processes or procedures to meet their team members' needs better. This can help recent graduates feel more empowered and engaged in their work and help the organisation stay competitive and adapt to changing circumstances.
								</p>
								<p>	
									I used to work with a manager who constantly strived to work smarter, not harder. He often suggested new ideas and allowed staff to experiment with new models and templates. I had the chance to apply my Power Query skills in many cases and received great feedback. It was a tremendous moral boost as I saw improvement in my work and abilities.

								<p>	
									<b>Caring</b>: New graduates often face a steep learning curve transitioning from academic life to the workforce. Managers who demonstrate a genuine interest in their team members' success and well-being can help new graduates feel supported and valued within the organisation.
								</p>
								<p>	
									A caring manager can show interest in their team members' personal and professional goals and work with them to create a plan for achieving them. They may offer guidance, mentorship, and feedback to help new graduates develop their skills and succeed in their roles.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Furthermore, a caring manager can create a positive and inclusive work environment by valuing diversity, fostering open communication, and promoting teamwork. They may encourage team members to share their ideas and perspectives and work collaboratively to solve problems and achieve common goals.
								</p>
								<p>	
									It's also worth noting that a caring manager can demonstrate empathy and understanding towards their team members' struggles and challenges. They may be willing to listen to their concerns and offer support and resources to help them overcome obstacles and succeed in their roles.
								</p>
								<p>	
									Overall, finding a good manager is crucial for young graduates to grow and improve. There are already so many tasks to learn in the first few jobs. It will be much more stressful if the manager is inflexible, passive and stubborn. If your manager does not possess the characteristics above, consider switching to another position.
