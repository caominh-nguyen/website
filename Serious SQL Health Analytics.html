								<br/><a href="https://github.com/caominh-nguyen/portfolio">Link to GitHub repository</a>, including data and final output.</p>
								<p><b>About the data set</b>
								<br/>Health data measured by users using their wearables and enter into a tracking device. Columns in the data table "user_logs" in the "health" schema are:
									<li>id: id of the users</li>
									<li>log_date: the date the record is entered</li>
									<li>measure: the type of measures, can be weight, blood glucose and blood pressure</li>
									<li>measure_value: measure values for weight and blood glucose</li>
									<li>systolic and diastolyc: measure values for blood pressure</li>
								</p>
