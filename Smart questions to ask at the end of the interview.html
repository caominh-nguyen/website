								<p>After gruesome 45-minute answering questions from the interview panel, it is your turn to ask questions. This is the chance for you to find out if this is actually the place and job you want to work for. However, the interview is still ongoing. Thus, ensure your questions continue to prove you are the right candidate for the position. I have a few suggestions on which questions to ask and which ones to avoid:
								</p>
								<p><b>Questions on performance:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>How my performance will be measured?</li> 
										<li>How often do we undertake performance reviews?</li>
										<li>What types of KPIs or targets I will be evaluated against?</li>
										<li>What are the short and medium goals in the role?</li>
									</ul>
								<p>When asking these questions, you are showing a sense of dutifulness. The answers from the interviewing panel will give you a hint on how the organisation focus on performing at work. An intense focus on performance may mean more chances to progress if you can cut through, but it also comes with higher expectations and pressure.
								</p>
								<p><b>Questions for the direct manager:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>How long have you been in your role?</li>
										<li>What are your favourite parts of working here?</li>
									</ul>
								<p>A boss new to the organisation or someone who just get a promotion to team leader may not be able to give you the most support that you need. However, it is also an opportunity to prove your ability to work independently and stay on good terms with the new boss. Pay attention to how they respond to the second question. If they are hesitant, it is a red flag.
								</p>
								<p><b>Questions about the organisation:</b></p>
								<p>A quick note: do your homework, and don’t ask about things that can be easily found with a Google search; try to link what you have read about the organisation to your questions.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Given the current W trend in the economy, how the organisation is responding?</li> 
									<li>I noticed the X strategy in the annual report, what are the challenges associated with this?</li> 
									<li>I see that Y is our best-selling product. Have we thought about diversifying or penetrating a new market?</li>
									<li>How will my role contribute to the organisation’s direction to the Z goal?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The purpose of the questions above is to show the interviewer that you are serious about the job, you have done the research and you have a view of the big picture, too. How the interviewers respond may indicate if the company is adapting to the operating environment. If they do not actively assess and react to the environment, what are they even doing?
								</p>
								<p><b>Questions about the culture:</b></p>
								<p>Obviously, no hiring manager will tell you that the workplace is toxic with high staff turnover and low morale. You need to phrase your questions carefully to uncover any red flags, but not explicitly ask about them.
								</p>
									<ul>	
										<li>Have you ever participated in joint projects with other departments? If the answer is rare/no, there might be a silo effect going on.</li>
										<li>Is there an office tradition that you love? Pay attention to how long the person comes up with an answer.</li>
										<li>How has the organisation changed since you joined? The keyword here is ‘change’ - which is neutral. Listen closely to see if there are improvements or challenges or simply stay the same.</li>
									</ul>	
								<p><b>Questions about professional growth:</b></p>
								<p>Career progression brings satisfaction and helps you to keep up with inflation. Therefore, don’t be afraid to ask about development and promotion. If there is little room to grow, reconsider the position.
								</p>
									<ul>	
										<li>How do we invest in professional development for staff?</li>
										<li>What types of learning that the team undertake to keep pace with changes?</li>
										<li>What are the typical career paths for this position?</li>
										<li>How are promotions usually considered?</li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>Closing questions: </b></p>
								<p>Don’t forget to ask about the next steps in the hiring process and any points that the interviewers are still unclear about your answers previously. Hopefully, they will give you a chance to address those.

								<p><b>Questions to Avoid:</b></p>
								<p>Avoid asking about salary, leave policies and other employee benefits. You will come across as too financially motivated. Employers may view this type of candidate with scepticism (a higher chance of conducting unethical behaviour for financial gain). If you want to ask about compensation, you either ask about it over the phone before applying (for a range to consider) or once the employer starts the salary discussion. Once they decide to hire you, you have more leverage in the negotiation.
								</p>
								Of course, you are not going to ask all the questions above. Before you start asking, confirm with the interview panel the time you have. Only choose the ones that are most important to you and most relevant to the role you are applying for. Also, write down the questions you want to ask in a notebook, so you don’t forget. Taking note of the answers will show you are an organised person.
								I hope this article has helped you to arm yourself in the next interview. Let me know if you have any feedback using the suggested questions above.
